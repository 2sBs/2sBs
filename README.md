# Hi there, I'm Luther 👋

I'm an amateur coder currently studying a Bachelor of IT at QUT. I like working with JavaScript (especially with ReactJS) and C# :)

I also do stuff in esports as a match commentator/shoutcaster and co-host the CS:GO podcast 'Round-Up' on [Snowball Esports](https://snowballesports.com/).
