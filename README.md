# Hi there, I'm Luther 👋

I'm a software developer based in Brisbane, Australia - currently in my final year of studying a Bachelor of IT (Computer Science major) at QUT. I love working with ReactJS, React Native, C#, Java and Python.

I also do stuff in esports as a match commentator/shoutcaster and co-host the CS:GO podcast 'Round-Up' on [Snowball Esports](https://snowballesports.com/).
