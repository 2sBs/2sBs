# Hi there, I'm Luther 👋

I'm a software developer based in Brisbane, Australia - currently working as a full-time web developer at [Jaden Digital](https://jadendigital.com.au)! I'm a QUT graduate with a Bachelor of Information Technology (Computer Science major).

I'm proficient with application development in JavaScript/TypeScript, including React, React Native and Next.js - alongside cross-platform development in C#, Java and Python. I'm highly proficient with AI tools and agentic development, and experienced in working with large-scale projects across a full development stack.

Outside of the IT sector, I'm also a Counter-Strike commentator - working with a number of local and international tournament organisers to provide quality analysis and casting, aiming to elevate any broadcasts I'm on and put on the best show possible!
